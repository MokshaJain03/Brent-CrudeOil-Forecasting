# Brent-CrudeOil-Forecasting
# Understanding the shifting prices in Crude Oil is imperative to grasp the market fluctuations and volatility and the wider market dynamics . This project focuses on forecasting Brent Crude oil average weekly prices, employing the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Facebook Prophet. After obtaining the publicly available data, which is available on the official website of the Energy Information Administration, we conduct repetitive experiments which exploit the data to predict future trip counts for all models. The performance is then evaluated by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and RSME. Additionally, this project also investigates the intricate relationship between economic factors, particularly the impact of global supply and demand dynamics on crude oil prices.
